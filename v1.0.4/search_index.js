The paper by Merz has a good discussion of how to lay out the dataset.","category":"page"},{"location":"#","page":"Home","title":"Home","text":"\nfunction do_reweighting(\n    ;\n    data,              # either AbstractMatrix or e.g dataframe\n    initial_weights    :: AbstractVector, # a column\n    target_populations :: AbstractVector, # a row\n    functiontype       :: DistanceFunctionType,\n    upper_multiple     = 0.0,\n    lower_multiple     = 0.0,\n    tol                = 10^(-10),\n    max_iterations     = 100 )\n","category":"page"},{"location":"#","page":"Home","title":"Home","text":"See the tests for simple examples, based on examples from the Creedy paper.","category":"page"},{"location":"#","page":"Home","title":"Home","text":"The form of 'closeness' used is determined by the functiontype parameter of enumerated type DistanceFunctionType.
